Bugs to fix:
=> Make show solution button work
=> Make number of regions always equal to number of rows and columns
=> Future: Have a list of randomly generated puzzles such that region of one colour is continuous, and on each refrech, a different puzzle should be chosen
=> Pull this to main branch
